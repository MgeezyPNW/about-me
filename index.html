                    <p>At Horseshoe Lake Golf Course, I was in charge of the overall customer experience from the minute they park to the minute they leave. I took our average membership sign-up rate from 5% to 27% during my tenure.</p>

            <h2>Goals</h2>
                <p>My major goal is somewhat cliche... but it doesn't make it any less serious. I want to find a career in the tech industry that will provide a life that my fiance and son deserve. They are my inspiration, my WHY... To see them happy and comfortable is my end goal.</p>
